This piece holds a special place in my heart. From a turbulent time of my life, it reminds me however high the emotions can get, they shall too pass. Feels like setting emotions free by the ocean. I found unexpected surprises after I finished this painting; I found jumping dolphins, angel wings, and kissing birds. Do you see them? What else can you find?
