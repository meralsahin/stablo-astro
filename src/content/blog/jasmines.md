Oh, the smell of jasmines. I can never seem to find a perfume that does its justice. We had trailing jasmine growing up in our garden, and I still remember the lingering fragrance coming from the windows waking up to it every morning. It brings back sweet childhood memories for me, back at our old summer house.
