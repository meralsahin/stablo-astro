I feel lost in an enchanted forest looking at this wisteria. Bright lights peeking through its flowers, itâ€™s inviting you to go to its magical garden. I love it when it blooms in May here in London. I finally have a blooming one in my garden called Amethyst Falls, but having it as a painting means I can enjoy it all year round.
