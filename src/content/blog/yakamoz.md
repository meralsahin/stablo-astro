Yakamoz is a Turkish word. It is one of my favourite words that I canâ€™t seem to find a satisfying translation in another language. Yakamoz means the sparkle of light reflecting on the sea at night. This one is a colourful representation of the evening sky and moon, bringing all sorts of feelings to life.
